# The Dodge (Backend)

The backend for The Dodge supports the game's functionality by providing a robust and secure server-side infrastructure. 
This project leverages modern web technologies to handle game data, user authentication, and more.

This backend project uses the following technologies:

- **Programming Language**: TypeScript
- **Server Framework**: Node.js with ExpressJS
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Token)
- **Other Tools**: Mongoose (ODM), bcrypt (for password hashing), dotenv (for environment variables)

Stay tuned for a Dev Blog where I will dive deeper into the creation process and the tools used.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration using JWT.
- **Data Management**: Efficient data storage and retrieval with MongoDB.
- **Game Logic**: Handles game state and interactions.
- **Leaderboards**: Manages and displays player rankings.
- **Relics and Power-ups**: Supports dynamic game elements.
