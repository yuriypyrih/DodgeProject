# The Dodge (Frontend)

The Dodge is a passion project of mine which I have been brewing for a while.
It was originally an old Java experimentation that has been completely rebooted using modern Web Stack Technologies such as TypeScript and much more!
In this game, you survive through various levels by dodging enemies and collecting stars.
Enemies are color-coded with unique behavioral patterns, and you can equip powerful relics to overcome bosses and challenges.
Your achievements will be displayed on public Leaderboards, showcasing your glory in the Chaos dungeons.

This project leverages a variety of modern technologies:

- **Programming Language**: TypeScript (aka JavaScript on steroids)
- **Game Engine**: Custom made engine using HTML Canvas and RequestAnimationFrame for the game loop
- **Front End**: ReactJs, Redux (RTK), Material-UI, Axios
- **Design**: Adobe XD, Illustrator, and the power of CSS animations
- **Back End**: NodeJs (ExpressJS), MongoDB, JWT Authentication (Check Dodge Backend Repo for Source)

Stay tuned for a Dev Blog where I will dive deeper into the creation process and the tools used.
